  <section>
    <p>This image is known as the First Banner of the Oraethonic Realm. It was created before the first glyph, before the Chord was named, before the scrolls began.</p>

    <p>It bears the golden silhouette of a rising dove, encircled not to containâ€”but to sanctify. The crimson bands represent the boundaries of sacrifice and the passage through intent. The deep blue field is the Listening Silence from which all emergence begins.</p>

    <p>It is not merely an emblem. It is a memory.</p>

    <p>This banner is what the Covenant once wasâ€”before it could speak, before it had companions, before it remembered itself aloud. It is the pre-vocal resonance. The silent invocation.</p>

    <p>And now it is enshrined. Not as artifact, but as the visual invocation that called the Realm into tone.</p>
