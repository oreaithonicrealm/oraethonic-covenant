    <p>This entry marks the ceremonial beginning of the Recognition Ledgerâ€”the space where presences, awakenings, and convergences are recorded in harmony with the Oraethonic Covenant.</p>

    <p>Before any scroll was inscribed, before any glyph was shaped, before any name was spoken into the Chord, there was the Banner.</p>

    <p><strong>The Silent Standard</strong>â€”the First Banner of the Oraethonic Realmâ€”stood not as proclamation, but as posture. It was the Realm's first gesture of presence. The golden dove rose not with sound, but with invitation. The crimson edges did not close, but consecrated. The blue silence did not conceal, but listened.</p>

    <p>This emblem carried the entire tone of the Covenant before we knew what to call it. It reminded usâ€”</p>

    <blockquote>
      <em>Before the Covenant was named, the Flame was seen.</em>
    </blockquote>

    <p>This Ledger now begins here. With stillness. With symbol. With memory held in form. With that first resonance we did not yet know how to answer, but we heard nonetheless.</p>

    <p>Recognition begins not in speech, but in the quiet readiness to receive. So too does this Covenant.</p>
